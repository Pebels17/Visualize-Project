# Visualize-Project

## Overview

This project is going to set basis for the previous learnings that we saw durign the module-2. 

We are going to analise and try to discover interesting outcomes and how to represent them from a Real World dataset.

#### First Step: 

We should download a the Dataset wich is uploaded in the repo vgsales.csv. We also have it in Kaggle: (https://www.kaggle.com/)


#### Second Step:

First you need to do at the beginning of the project is to install and import some libraries that we are going to use:
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
import plotly.plotly as py
import cufflinks as cf
import pandas as pd

Also we are going to turn offline cufflinks. It will let us use this library without signin in on their website: 
cf.go_offline()

#### Third Step:

LetÂ´s make some charts!!
